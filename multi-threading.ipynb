    "1.Multithreading in an interactive application enables a program to continue running even if a section is blocked or executing a lengthy process, increasing user responsiveness.\n",
    "2. Resource Sharing\n",
    "3. Economy Because threads share a memory with the process to which they belong, establishing and context switching threads is more cost-effective.\n",

    "5. Better Communication\n",
    "6. Utilization of multiprocessor architecture\n",

    "Disadvantages: \n",
    "1.It needs more careful synchronization.\n",
    "2.It can consume a large space of stocks of blocked threads.\n",
    "3.It needs support for thread or process.\n",
    "4.If a parent process has several threads for proper process functioning, the child processes should also be multithreaded because they may be required.\n",

    "Ans. Deadlock:\n",
    "A deadlock is a concurrency failure mode where a thread or threads wait for a condition that never occurs. The result is that the deadlock threads are unable to progress and the program is stuck or frozen and must be terminated forcefully.\n",
    "Race condition:\n",
    "Race condition occurs when multiple threads read and write the same variable i.e. they have access to some shared data and they try to change it at the same time. In such a scenario threads are “racing” each other to access/change the data."
